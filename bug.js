This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is a common issue in React Native applications that use asynchronous operations to fetch data or update state values. For example, if you try to access the `userData` variable before the `useEffect` hook has finished fetching data from an API, you may encounter this error. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the application crashing or displaying incorrect information. To resolve this issue, you should make sure that your component does not try to access state values before they have been properly initialized. You can check if the values are null or undefined before using them or use conditional rendering to avoid accessing the variables before they are set.
